## Spelling Corrector
This semester we had to implement a spelling corrector. After we implemented it successfully, we had to be tested on it by reimplementing it from scratch in under 4 hours.\
There are 3 classes that need implemented. The notes for how I implimented each are below.
- [Node Class](Media/node.jpg)
- [Trie Class](Media/trie.jpg)
- [Spelling Corrector](spell1.jpg)
- [Spelling Corrector Cont.](spell2.jpg)
