## Spelling Corrector
This semester we had to implement a spelling corrector. After we implemented it successfully, we had to be tested on it by reimplementing it from scratch in under 4 hours./
There are 3 classes that need implemented. The notes for how I implimented each are below.

- [Trie Class](trie.png)
- [Spelling Corrector](spell.png)
